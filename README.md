# Set up and running dev server
Once you have the repository on your local device, open up your terminal and navigate to the folder location. Then - after ensuring you have Node installed on your device - run the following command:
```
npm install
```

After that, you should then be able to run your dev server with the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
It should now be running on http://localhost:3000

# Running e2e tests
Cypress has been configured such that you can run an end-to-end test in the application. Assuming the dev server is running, simply run the command:
```
npm run cypress
```
